## Company Configuration

This application is designed to be easily customizable for different companies. All company-specific settings can be found in `src/config/company.ts`:

- Company name, logo, and branding colors
- User settings and greeting preferences  
- Search options and client lists
- Custom workflows and integrations

## Workflow System

Workflows are modular and stored in the `src/workflows/` directory. Each workflow has its own folder containing:

- `config.ts` - Workflow definition with fields and options
- Future: Custom logic, integrations, and UI components

To add a new workflow:
1. Create a new folder in `src/workflows/`
2. Add a `config.ts` file with the workflow definition
3. Export the workflow in `src/workflows/index.ts`

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: AI-powered conversational interface with company-specific greetings
- **Workflow Management**: Structured processes for common business tasks
- **Reminders System**: Integration with external systems for task management
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to customize and extend for different companies
